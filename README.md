# Image Denoiser (Deep Learning)

This project implements an image denoising pipeline using a convolutional autoencoder. The model takes a noisy RGB image as input and predicts a clean (denoised) version of the image.

## Features
- Pre-trained on noisy CIFAR-10 images
- Accepts user-uploaded noisy images (32x32)
- Produces side-by-side visualization of noisy and denoised output
- 
## Dataset
- **CIFAR-10**
